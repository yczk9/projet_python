"5.1","Présentation statistique","Description des données","The FAOSTAT domain on Land Cover data under the Agri-Environmental Indicators section contains land cover information organized by the land cover classes of the international standard system for Environmental and Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA CF). The land cover information is compiled from publicly available Global Land Cover (GLC) maps: a) MODIS land cover types based on the Land Cover Classification System, LCCS (2001–2021); b) The European Spatial Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) annual land cover maps (1992–2020) produced by the Université catholique de Louvain (UCL)-Geomatics and now under the European Copernicus Program; c) The annual land cover maps which were produced under the European Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) (CGLS land cover, containing discrete land cover categorization for the period 2015–2019), with spatial resolution 100m; and d) 4) The WorldCover maps of the European Space Agency —available for the years 2020 and 2021, produced at 10m resolution."

"5.4","Présentation statistique","Concepts et définitions statistiques","Land is a central component of economic and environmental accounting. As defined by the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA CF) land is “a unique environmental asset that delineates the space in which economic activities and environmental processes take places and within which environmental assets and economic assets are located”. Land cover refers to the observed physical and biological land cover of the Earth’s surface, and includes natural vegetation and abiotic (non-living) surfaces (SEEA CF, 5.257). The land cover classification of the SEEA CF currently is the international standard to prepare the physical accounts for land cover. The SEEA Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries SEEA-AFF (FAO and UN, 2020) also applies the land cover classification of the SEEA CF. In the scope of the SEEA CF and SEEA AFF, land cover information is relevant for understanding the changing composition and condition of countries ecosystems, including its agricultural and forest landscape. A physical asset account for land cover with opening stocks, additions and reductions to stock, recording of net changes and closing stock is formulated in the SEEA AFF (Table 4.9 Physical land cover asset account)."

"17.1","Processus statistique","Données sources","The UN SEEA Central Framework is the source of the land cover classification. The FAOSTAT “Land Cover” domain disseminates country statistics of land cover as a public knowledge product and to support the preparation of physical asset accounts for land cover. The underlying information is derived from publicly available global land cover maps (GLC). The FAOSTAT Land Cover domain applies a common methodology to these GLC products, providing users with a globally consistent, harmonized dataset: 1) The land cover maps, hereinafter called CCI-LC, produced by the Catholic University of Louvain (UCLouvain) Geomatics as part of the Climate Change Initiative of the European Spatial Agency (version 2.0, CCI UCL Geomatics, 2017), with spatial resolution 300m. CCI-LC was updated to version 2.1 under the European Copernicus program (2019). Data are available from 1992 onwards;2) The NASA MODIS Land Cover Collection 6.1 (MCD12Q1) available from 2001 onwards (Sulla-Menashe et al., 2019; Sulla-Menashe and Friedl, 2022). In particular, the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) land cover types — spatial resolution 500m are used to generate SEEA-MODIS statistics of land cover. 3) The annual land cover maps which were produced under the European Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) (CGLS land cover, containing discrete land cover categorization for the period 2015–2019), with spatial resolution 100m (Buchhorn et al., 2020). 4) The ESA WorldCover maps—2020 v100 and 2021 v200 maps— (Zanaga et al., 2021; Zanaga et al., 2022) produced at 10m resolution.

The FAO Statistics and Data Quality Assurance Framework (SDQAF), available at: https://www.fao.org/3/cc6683en/cc6683en.pdf, provides the necessary principles, guidelines and tools to carry out quality assessments. FAO is performing an internal bi-annual survey (QAPS) designed to gather information on all of FAO’s statistical activities, notably to assess the extent to which quality standards are being implemented with a view to increasing compliance with the quality dimensions of SDQAF, documenting best practices and prepare quality improvement plans, where necessary. Domain-specific quality assurance activities are carried out systematically (e.g. qualityreviews, self-assessments, compliance monitoring)."
