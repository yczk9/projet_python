"5.1","Statistical presentation","Data description","The FAOSTAT Land Use domain contains data on twenty-one land use categories and twenty-three categories of irrigation and agricultural practices. Data are available yearly and by country, regional and global levels. The domain includes Land Use Indicators providing information on the percentage share of agricultural and forest land, and their sub-components, including irrigated areas and areas under organic agriculture, within a country land use matrix. Data are available at country, regional and global level, for the following elements: (in percentage) i) Share in Land area; ii) Share in Agricultural land, iii) Share in Cropland; and iv) Share in Forest land; (in ha/pc) v) Area per capita."

"5.4","Statistical presentation","Statistical concepts and definitions","Land use indicates the socioeconomic use of land (for example, agriculture, forestry, recreation or residential use). In particular it defines a number of services such as agriculture, forestry, industry, transport, housing and other services that use land as a natural and/or economic resource. Land use has to be distinguished from Land Cover which refers instead to to the bio-physical coverage of land (for example, crops, grass, broad-leaved forest, or built-up area).The FAOSTAT Land Use domain includes categories of land primarily focusing on their use for agricultural and forestry activities. Definitions of these items (land categories) are available at: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL.These definitons are compliant with those included in the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (SEEA AFF), the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA CF) and the Framework for the Development of Environmental Statistics (FDES 2013)"

Organic agriculture: Data collected and disseminated by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) are used to complement information on FAOSTAT items “Area certified organic” and “Area in conversion to certified organic” items. Temporary crops, Temporary meadows and pastures and Temporary fallow: data on the three subcomponents of “Arable land” are collected since 2001 and gap filled as follows: i) Relevant information is sourced from agricultural censuses and surveys; ii) When one sub-component was missing and the other two were officially reported, it was computed as a balance; and iii) Incomplete time series for each sub-component were linearly interpolated from official values. Additionally global shares of the three subcomponents are computed from official data and normalized to the corresponding area of Arable land of that year. Global shares are further used in gap-filling as follows: a) When all three sub-components were missing, the global shares are applied as such to the area of Arable land; b) When official or interpolated values for one subcomponent were available, the global shares are applied giving precedence to the global shares of Temporary crops, considered as the most important subcomponent, or alternatively to the global shares of Temporary fallow land. Values for the remaining subcomponent are filled as a balance; and c) When only one official data point by subcomponent was available, the yearly net change of the global shares was first applied backwards or forwards to gap-fill the time series. Land Use Indicators are available for the following elements: (in percent) i) Share in Land area; ii) Share in Agricultural land, iii) Share in Cropland iv) Share in Forest land; and v) (in ha/pc) Area per capita."
"18.1","Quality management","Quality assurance","FAO is responsible for the quality of the internal statistical processes used to compile the published datasets. The FAO Statistics and Data Quality Assurance Framework (SDQAF), available at: https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/01debb18-63b2-403b-87fe-0eca5409656e, provides the necessary principles, guidelines and tools to carry out quality assessments. FAO is performing an internal bi-annual survey (FAO Quality Assessment and Planning Survey) designed to gather information on all of FAO’s statistical activities, notably to assess the extent to which quality standards are being implemented with a view to increasing compliance with the quality dimensions of SDQAF, documenting best practices and prepare quality improvement plans, where necessary. Domain-specific quality assurance activities are carried out systematically (e.g. quality reviews, self-assessments, compliance monitoring)."
